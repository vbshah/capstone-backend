<h4>In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called a simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.</h4>

<p>The dataset "Televisions, Physicians, and Life Expectancy" contains, among other variables, the number of people per television set and the number of people per physician for 40 countries. Since both variables probably reflect the level of wealth in each country, it is reasonable to assume that there is some positive association between them. After removing 8 countries with missing values from the dataset, the remaining 32 countries have a correlation coefficient of 0.852 for the number of people per television set and the number of people per physician. The&nbsp;<em>r&sup2;</em>&nbsp;value is 0.726 (the square of the correlation coefficient), indicating that 72.6% of the variation in one variable may be explained by the other.&nbsp;Suppose we choose to consider a number of people per television set as the explanatory variable, and the number of people per physician as the dependent variable. Using the MINITAB "REGRESS" command gives the following results:</p>
